# Adaptive Notch Filter with Improved Tracking Properties - Digital Signal Processing Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the **Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF)** described in the paper:

> **M. V. Dragosevic and S. S. Stankovic**, "An adaptive notch filter with improved tracking properties,"  
> *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing*, vol. 43, no. 9, pp. 2068-2078, Sept. 1995.  
> [ðŸ”— DOI: 10.1109/78.414768](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/414768)

The ANF is designed to track and suppress narrowband sinusoidal interference adaptively. This implementation includes:
- Frequency adaptation algorithms
- Alpha and rho parameter adaptation
- Performance validation using different test signals

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Adaptive Notch Filtering**: Tracks and suppresses sinusoidal signals in real-time.
- **Dual Adaptation Mechanism**: Adjusts both **frequency** and **filter parameters (alpha & rho)**.
- **MATLAB-Based Implementation**: Fully implemented in MATLAB for simulation and validation.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Details
The implementation follows two key adaptation strategies from the reference paper:
1. **Frequency Adaptation**: Adjusts the notch filterâ€™s central frequency dynamically.
2. **Alpha & Rho Adaptation**: Ensures stability and improved tracking by constraining the filter parameters.

The ANF function **`anf_imp`** takes:
- An **input signal**
- A **percentage parameter** controlling the adaptation of alpha and rho.

### ðŸ”Ž Test Signals Used:
We verify the implementation using four different test signals:
1. **Pure Sinusoidal Signal**:  
   \[
   x_1(k) = \cos(\phi_1(k))
   \]
2. **Sinusoidal Signal with AWGN Noise**:  
   \[
   x_2(k) = \cos(\phi_1(k)) + 0.05\cdot\eta(k)
   \]
3. **Exponentially Varying Frequency Signal**:  
   \[
   x_3(k) = \cos(\phi_2(k))
   \]
4. **Exponentially Varying Frequency Signal with Noise**:  
   \[
   x_4(k) = \cos(\phi_2(k)) + 0.05\cdot\eta(k)
   \]

Where:
- \(\phi_1(k) = 2\pi(0.1 + 0.15(k/N))k\)
- \(\phi_2(k) = 2\pi(0.1 + 0.15\exp(-2k/N))k\)
- \(\eta(k)\) represents **AWGN noise**.

### ðŸ“Š Observations:
- The **ANF adapts quickly** due to both frequency and alpha adaptation.
- The **output signal retains only noise**, effectively suppressing the sinusoidal component.
- The **RLS filter performs best** in noisy environments but at a higher computational cost.
